You are a scientist and you have to save the world from epidemy.
Your company has designed three drugs, and you must check if they work.
Your task is to choose which drug works using the first trial's data.
However, first, you have to set up your Visual Studio Code environment.

Please Use Python or R.

**You SUCCEEDED when GitHub actions pipeline will pass (green color).**

Note: If this is a guided tutorial, please—if possible—use two screens: one to display the teacher’s screen and the other for your own work.

Checklist for Success:

- Fork the vsctuto repository on GitHub.
- Inspect the `.github/workflows` and click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them" in the Actions Tab.

Visual Studio Code Settings (20 minutes)

- Please use GitHub "Fn + ." to access web vscode. 
- Stage, Commit and Push the `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/extensions.json` files. [JSONC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#JSONC) is acceptable. Please refer to [python_codespace](https://www.github.com/polkas/python_codespace) or [r_codespace](https://www.github.com/polkas/r_codespace) repositories with `.vscode` directories. The .vscode folder contains environment-specific JSON files for editor settings, debugging configurations, and task automation.
- Reload the window of the web vscode session and inspect what changed.
- Create a `LICENSE` file. [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com/) can be helpful.
- Change the editor font size in Settings to 15. In settings, Copy the editor font size setting JSON. Add the editor font size setting JSON to the `.vscode/settings.json` file.
- Please find out the id for vscode pets extension. Add the extension id to the `.vscode/extensions.json` file. 
- Check out what changed in the Extensions tab. Install the vscode pets extension.
- Run the pet session.
- Stage, Commit and Push the changes.

Devcontainer (Secure Cloud Based Solution) (10 minutes)

- Please use GitHub "Fn + ." to access web vscode. 
- Stage, Commit and Push the a devcontainer `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file for Python or R. Please refer to [python_codespace](https://www.github.com/polkas/python_codespace) or [r_codespace](https://www.github.com/polkas/r_codespace) repositories with .devcontainer directories. The .devcontainer folder holds the container configuration to build a consistent, reproducible development environment.
- Run the Codespaces on GitHub. Now you have a few minutes to explore the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.
- Validate your codespace and whether it was built successfully.

Analysis (20+ minutes)

- Open the Codespaces for `vsctuto` on GitHub. 
- Load and explore the Trial data in `data/data.csv` using your own analysis script to determine which drug works. The installed extensions and settings should hint you the function names and format the file on save. You need to install R or Python dependencies like pandas, although it is possible to use only standard library.
- [BONUS] Validate your results with GitHub Copilot. Use GitHub Copilot Agent mode and ask "Please analyze the data in data.csv to determine which drug has the highest cure rate compared to the placebo. Update the [Python|R] script if necessary, and ensure the correct result ("Drug A" or "Drug B" or "Drug C" or "None") is written to solution.txt.". You can further ask about, for example effect size.
- Please write down a string with the name of the working drug in the `solution.txt` file, "Drug A" or "Drug B" or "Drug C" or "None".
- Stage, Commit and Push your work.

**Thank you for your work**
